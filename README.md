# Astrojax-usingMatLab
We use Matlab to describe the movement of "Astrojax"

In patch 1, our matlab files describe such situation:a physical scene: the top ball is static, while the other two is moving with no damp.

In patch 2, we add some physical conditions to make our simulation closer to the facts: the top ball is making a circular motion on the xy plane. The other two balls are moving with it. It is worth mentioning that on this patch we add damp to simulate the air resistence.
